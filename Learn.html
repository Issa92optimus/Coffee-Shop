                <h2>History of Coffee</h2>
                <p>No one knows exactly how or when coffee was discovered, though there are many legends about its origin.</p>
                
                <h3>An Ethopian Legend</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to the ancient coffee forests on the Ethiopian plateau.
                There, legend says the goat herder Kaldi first discovered the potential of these beloved beans.
                
                The story goes that that Kaldi discovered coffee after he noticed that after eating the berries from a certain tree, his
                goats became so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night.
                
                Kaldi reported his findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who made a drink with the berries and found that it
                kept him alert through the long hours of evening prayer. The abbot shared his discovery with the other monks at the
                monastery, and knowledge of the energizing berries began to spread.
                
                As word moved east and coffee reached the Arabian peninsula, it began a journey which would bring these beans across the
                globe.
                </p>

                <h3>The New World</h3>
                <hr>
                    
                <p>In the mid-1600's, coffee was brought to New Amsterdam, later called New York by the British.
                
                Though coffee houses rapidly began to appear, tea continued to be the favored drink in the New World until 1773, when
                the colonists revolted against a heavy tax on tea imposed by King George III. The revolt, known as the Boston Tea Party,
                would forever change the American drinking preference to coffee.

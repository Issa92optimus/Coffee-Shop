                <h2>History of Coffee</h2>
                <p>No one knows exactly how or when coffee was discovered, though there are many legends about its origin.</p>
                
                <h3>An Ethopian Legend</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to the ancient coffee forests on the Ethiopian plateau.
                There, legend says the goat herder Kaldi first discovered the potential of these beloved beans.
                
                The story goes that that Kaldi discovered coffee after he noticed that after eating the berries from a certain tree, his
                goats became so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night.
                
                Kaldi reported his findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who made a drink with the berries and found that it
                kept him alert through the long hours of evening prayer. The abbot shared his discovery with the other monks at the
                monastery, and knowledge of the energizing berries began to spread.
                
                As word moved east and coffee reached the Arabian peninsula, it began a journey which would bring these beans across the
                globe.
                </p>
                    <h3>Coffee comes to Europe</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>European travelers to the Near East brought back stories of an unusual dark black beverage. By the 17th century, coffee
                    had made its way to Europe and was becoming popular across the continent.
                    
                    Some people reacted to this new beverage with suspicion or fear, calling it the “bitter invention of Satan.” The local
                    clergy condemned coffee when it came to Venice in 1615. The controversy was so great that Pope Clement VIII was asked to
                    intervene. He decided to taste the beverage for himself before making a decision, and found the drink so satisfying that
                    he gave it papal approval.
                    
                    Despite such controversy, coffee houses were quickly becoming centers of social activity and communication in the major
                    cities of England, Austria, France, Germany and Holland. In England “penny universities” sprang up, so called because
                    for the price of a penny one could purchase a cup of coffee and engage in stimulating conversation.
                    
                    Coffee began to replace the common breakfast drink beverages of the time — beer and wine. Those who drank coffee instead
                    of alcohol began the day alert and energized, and not surprisingly, the quality of their work was greatly improved. (We
                    like to think of this a precursor to the modern office coffee service.)
                    
                    By the mid-17th century, there were over 300 coffee houses in London, many of which attracted like-minded patrons,
                    including merchants, shippers, brokers and artists.
                    
                    Many businesses grew out of these specialized coffee houses. Lloyd's of London, for example, came into existence at the
                    Edward Lloyd's Coffee House.

                <h3>The New World</h3>
                <hr>
                    
                <p>In the mid-1600's, coffee was brought to New Amsterdam, later called New York by the British.
                
                Though coffee houses rapidly began to appear, tea continued to be the favored drink in the New World until 1773, when
                the colonists revolted against a heavy tax on tea imposed by King George III. The revolt, known as the Boston Tea Party,
                would forever change the American drinking preference to coffee.
